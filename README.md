# Fake_news_detector
Detecting Fake News with Python â€“ About the Python Project This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.


# <<<< OUTPUT >>>>
# Accuracy: 92.66%
# array([[588,  50],
#        [ 43, 586]])

# So with this model, we have 589 true positives, 587 true negatives,
# 42 false positives, and 49 false negatives.
